## About TermSCP

TermSCP is basically a porting of WinSCP to terminal. So basically is a terminal tool with an UI to connect to a remote server to retrieve and upload files. It works both on Linux, MacOS and Windows (TODO: double check) and supports SFTP and FTPS.

### Why TermSCP

It happens very often to me when using SCP at work to forget the path of a file on a remote machine, which forces me then to connect through SSH, gather the file path and finally download it through SCP. I could use WinSCP, but I use Linux and I pratically use the terminal for everything, so I wanted something like WinSCP on my terminal.

## Features

- Different communication protocols
  - SFTP
  - FTPS
- Practical user interface to explore the remote machine file system and to select the files to upload and download
- Written in Rust
- Easy to extend with new protocols
